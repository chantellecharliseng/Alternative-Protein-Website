              Work on cultivated meat would greatly benefit from more bioengineers and others working on biotechnology as they could help design cell scaffolding and tissue structuring as well as cell growth factor optimization. In addition, they could help scale up the production of cultivated meats to a level in which they could be mass produced. <br>
              You can build career capital to get into this area by earning a degree in bioengineering (biological, biomaterial, biomedical, or bioprocess engineering), interning at alternative protein companies in equipment research and development positions, and learning more about stem cell growth and cultivated meat formulation.

            In order to produce cultivated meat, particularly at scale, cultivated meat cells need to be grown in bioreactors, manufactured devices that support biologically active environments. Cell culture bioreactors are used extensively in the medical field to produce pharmaceuticals, vaccines, or antibodies and use cell lines (e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary cells - CHO) that are specifically designed for medical applications. Chemical engineers can play a massive role in designing bioreactors for cultivated meat facilities, which will allow for these facilities to produce cells at large volumes with low complexity. Specifically, chemical engineers can help adapt bioreactors cultivated meat cells, as opposed to the cell lines used in the medical industry. They can also develop and improve methods for adapting meat cells to suspension culture, as opposed to adherent cell culture. Finally, chemical engineers can discover and develop methods to capture useful side stream products that are produced during animal cell metabolism within cultivators, which can serve as an additional source of revenue for cultivated meat companies. <br>

            Someone has to design the equipment used to make alternative proteins (i.e. extruders, shear cells, cultivated meat bioreactors, fermentors). This is where mechanical engineers could use their skills to help further develop the alternative protein space. One of the main reasons which prevents alternative proteins from gaining a greater portion of the global protein market is their currently higher cost compared to conventional protein sources (meat, eggs, and dairy). Creating better versions of the equipment used in producing alternative proteins could substantially help to bring down the cost of alternative proteins to become on par (or even cheaper) than conventional protein sources, leading to greater consumer sales to facilitate the transition to a food system with less animal products. <br>

              As alternative proteins companies continue to scale up, they will move beyond pilot scale facilities and co-manufacturers to make their products. This means they will aim to build their own production plants, like Plant & Bean in the U.K., which will require numerous engineers. Automation engineers are needed to set up the controls for the equipment. Civil engineers can design the structure of these plants to handle the loads as well as HVAC and plumbing requirements. Electrical engineers would be responsible for installing the electrical systems within the plant thus allowing it to be fully functional (electrical engineers could also be useful for biosensor development for bioreactors). <br>
              This is by no means an exhaustive list of all engineering fields related to ending factory farming. More relevant types of engineering fields can be found here (however, these are specific to cultivated meat).
