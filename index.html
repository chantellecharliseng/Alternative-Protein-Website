               <p3>We are a group of students from The University of Waterloo who are a part of our university chapter of Engineers Without Borders Canada because we are passionate about using our creative and technical skills to implement systems change in the world. Engineers Without Borders is a nonprofit organization that empowers young people to apply their knowledge to develop solutions. Their core missions are “Investing in People”, “Investing in Ventures”, and “Advocating for Change”. <br><br>
               At The University of Waterloo, Engineers Without Borders is a student design team, and a place where we can all harbour our thoughts together to create projects that will impose positive change. In particular, one of the projects that we are currently working on is The Alternative Protein Project.</p3>

               <p5>We are keen about working on this project because we know that there is an urgent need to turn away from traditional livestock meats and switch to alternative proteins instead. Meat production has been increasing rapidly in the recent years as more and more people are rising above the poverty line. <br><br>
               People rising above the poverty line? This is good. Yes… <br><br>
               However, this also means that more and more people can afford to feed the unsustainable practices that are performed to put a steak on a plate. Click here to learn more about why we need to end factory farming.</p5>

               <p7>To develop The Alternative Protein Project we have partnered with The Good Food Institute, which is an organization that aims to educate and promote the development of alternative proteins in the market. At The University of Waterloo, we aim to educate our fellow peers about alternative proteins as well. However, in addition to education, our goal is to help other students find career paths in the alternative protein sector. There are currently vast and numerous opportunities in this new sector for coop placements and newly graduated students that are waiting to be taken.
