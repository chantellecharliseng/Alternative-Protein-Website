               Have you ever been to Burger King and ordered the Impossible Whopper? Or been to A&W and ordered the Beyond Meat Burger? Both of these products are plant-based meats. As consumers, those are what we define as alternative protein products. However, there is so much more to the plant-based meat spectrum than just these orders from fast-food chains!

               Plant-based meat is produced directly from plants. Instead of relying on an animal to convert plants into meat, we can make meat more efficiently by skipping the animal and turning plant ingredients directly into meat. Like animal-based meat, plant-based meat is composed of protein, fat, vitamins, minerals, and water. Next-generation plant-based meat looks, cooks, and tastes like conventional meat.
